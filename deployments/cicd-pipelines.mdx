<Note>
  
    The CI/CD Pipelines feature automates the process of building, testing, and deploying applications efficiently. By integrating with version control repositories like GitHub and GitLab, it enables organisations to automate software delivery, minimizing manual intervention. This ensures that code changes are continuously integrated, tested, and deployed to production seamlessly, supporting a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflow. CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines in Cloudsania automate your application's build, test, and deployment processes.
