## What is An App Service?

<Note>
  Cloudsania's **App Services** provide a streamlined way to provision, deploy, and manage applications across cloud environments using pre-configured [**Konstacks**](/environments/konstacks). App services automate the deployment process, ensuring seamless integration with cloud providers and source control systems.
