### Cloud Connectors
Cloud Connectors are configuration settings that allow you to seamlessly and securely integrate your organization’s cloud provider accounts with Cloudsania’s automation platform. They act as a secure bridge between Cloudsania and your Cloud Provider, enabling smooth interaction while maintaining security and compliance.


## Deployment Components

### Environments
Environments in Cloudsania are isolated infrastructure spaces that represent different stages of your application lifecycle. Each environment is configured with its own set of resources, security policies, and access controls.

### Konstacks
Konstacks are pre-configured infrastructure templates in Cloudsania that allow users provision, configure, and manage cloud instances within their environments. It simplifies the process of deploying compute resources such as EC2, ECS instances, ensuring seamless scalability, availability, and reliability.


### Add-ons
Add-ons are pre-configured services that will extend your environment’s capabilities with essential infrastructure components like databases, caching solutions, and message queues. Each add-on will be deployed as an isolated, managed service within your environment.

### App Services
Pre-configured application deployment solutions that provide a streamlined way to provision, deploy, and manage applications across cloud environments using pre-configured Konstacks. App services automate the deployment process, ensuring seamless integration with cloud providers and source control systems.


## Network & Security

### DNS Management
The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, enabling seamless access to online services. It is essential for directing traffic and ensuring efficient communication between systems.
