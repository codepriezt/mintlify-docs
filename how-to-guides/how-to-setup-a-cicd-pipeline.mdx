### 1. Access Pipeline Configuration

1. Log in to Cloudsania
2. Navigate to your project
3. Go to **CI/CD Pipelines** 
4. Click **Create Pipeline**

### 2. Configure Source Control

1. Select your repository
2. Choose the branch
3. Configure trigger settings:
   - Push events
   - Pull request events
   - Tag events

### 3. Define Pipeline Stages

1. Build Stage
   - Choose build environment
   - Configure build commands
   - Set up dependencies

2. Test Stage
   - Configure test runners
   - Set up test environment
   - Define test commands

3. Deploy Stage
   - Select deployment environment
   - Configure deployment strategy
   - Set up rollback options

### 4. Environment Variables

1. Add required variables
2. Configure secrets
3. Set up environment-specific values

## Advanced Configuration

### Pipeline Optimization
- Caching strategies
- Parallel execution
- Resource allocation

### Security Settings
- Access control
- Secret management
- Compliance checks

### Monitoring and Logs
- Pipeline metrics
- Build logs
- Deployment status

## Best Practices

1. Pipeline Structure
   - Modular stages
   - Clear naming conventions
   - Efficient workflows

2. Testing Strategy
   - Automated testing
   - Integration tests
   - Performance tests

3. Deployment Strategy
   - Blue-green deployment
   - Canary releases
   - Rollback procedures

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
- Build failures
- Test failures
- Deployment issues
- Resource constraints

## Maintenance

1. Regular Updates
   - Pipeline configuration
   - Dependencies
   - Security patches

2. Performance Monitoring
   - Build times
   - Resource usage
   - Success rates
