## What is AWS Connector?

The AWS Connector in Cloudsania is a secure bridge between your Cloudsania account and AWS infrastructure.

## Changes Made to Your AWS Account

<Warning>
  When setting up an AWS Connector, several changes are made to your AWS account. Understanding these changes is crucial for security and compliance.
</Warning>

## IAM Users Created

When you set up an AWS Connector, Cloudsania creates several IAM users in your AWS account to handle different aspects of automation and management. Each user has specific responsibilities and permissions aligned with the principle of least privilege.
