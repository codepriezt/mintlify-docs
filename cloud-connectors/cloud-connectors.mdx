## What are Cloud Connectors?

Cloud Connectors are configuration settings that allow you to seamlessly and securely integrate your organization’s cloud provider accounts with Cloudsania’s automation platform. They act as a secure bridge between Cloudsania and your Cloud Provider, enabling smooth interaction while maintaining security and compliance.&#x20;

Upon a successful connection, Cloudsania can perform automated operations on your cloud resources, such as provisioning infrastructure, managing workloads, and monitoring cloud environments. This reduces complexity, enhances security, and optimizes operational efficiency.
